Frames is an AI-powered image management application that lets you organize, search, and discover your photos using natural language. Instead of manually tagging photos or searching through endless folders, simply describe what you're looking for—"sunset at the beach," "birthday party with cake," or "my dog playing in the snow"—and Frames finds the matching images instantly.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Image Search**: Uses Mistral's vision AI to analyze images and create vector embeddings stored in Pinecone for instant natural language search
- **Smart Organization**: Create albums, group related photos, and maintain custom ordering
- **Secure Multi-User Platform**: Complete data isolation with Better Auth authentication
- **AI Processing Pipeline**: Automatic image analysis, thumbnail generation, and secure cloud storage
